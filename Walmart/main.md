Walmart is the largest company in the world. As a result, the company has trillions of data transactions. Finding a way to democratize data and make it available for end-users is a massive challenge. The finance department has used Power BI as a key part of their solution. Power BI is a business analytics service provided by Microsoft. It delivers its clients interactive visualizations with self-service business intelligence capabilities, where end users can create reports and dashboards by themselves.
